# Automatic-OTA-Updates-ESP32
Recently, I received a request to make it easy for ME to update the firmware on MY ESP32. So, I thought about it and created a cool system. Now, when MY ESP32 turns on, it checks if there's a newer version of the software on the server. If there is, it updates itself and then gets back to work. No stress, no fuss!
